<h1>Makers doing good for Children with Disabilities</h1>

<p>Through the TOM program framework, selected teams work to leverage technologies and open source licensing to design and prototype replicable solutions that could solve challenges around the world. The Ethos at TOM is that these events are <strong>fully inclusive</strong>, therefore the children with disabilities work with the team and are not simply recipients of a service.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is an opportunity for student engineers and designers to participant and learn from experienced mentors throughout the design and prototyping process.</p>

<p>Teams are provided with every type of machine or material they would need during the 72 hours event and receive plenty of food, beverages and fun activities to keep the creativity flowing.</p>
