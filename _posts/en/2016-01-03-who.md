<h2 style="text-align:left;">Children with disabilities</h2>

TOM events are fully inclusive, therefore the need-knower is working with the team and is not simply a recipient. This is 
a unique opportunity for children with disabilities, aged under 18, studying and living in HCMC and families to present their challenges, as 
well as share ideas of products that would help their daily lives.

TOM events are bringing together multi-disciplinary teams. Register now your interest as a participant and get the opportunity to join one of the teams that would tackle a challenge shared by a need-knower.

If you have experience and expertise, then you can register as a mentor. Each team will be followed by one mentor in particular, but will have access to all the experts and mentors joining the event.
