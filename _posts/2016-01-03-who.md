<h2 style="text-align:left;">Children with disabilities</h2>

TOM events are fully inclusive, therefore the need-knower is working with the team and is not simply a recipient. This is 
a unique opportunity for children with disabilities, aged under 18, studying and living inn HCMC and families to present their challenges, as 
well as share ideas of products that would help their daily lives.
