<h1>Makers doing good for Children with Disabilities</h1>

<p>The TOM program framework is specifically designed to utilize exponential technologies and open source licensing to design and prototype replicable solutions that could solve challenges around the world. The Ethos at TOM is that these events are <em>fully inclusive</em>, therefore the need-knower is working with the team and is not simply a recipient and there is an opportunity for students to participant and learn from experienced mentors and throughout the design and prototyping process.</p>

<p>Teams are provided with every type of machine or material they would need during the 72 hour event and receive plenty of food, beverage and fun activities to keep the creativity flowing.</p>
